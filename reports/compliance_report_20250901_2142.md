**Run name:** daily_batch  
**Batch time:** 2025-08-30 23:23:56  
**Data window:** nan  
**Model version:** v1.0  
**Data source:** {'daily_file_pattern': 'data/new_batch_*.csv'}  
**Report owner:** Christine Ding (Data Scientist)

## 1) Executive Summary
Monitoring completed for the latest batch. AUC=0.692 and KS=0.285 are fine. Significant drift on 'fico_mid' (PSI=0.262). Missing data is within acceptable limits. Fairness meets the 80% rule.

---

## 2) Key Metrics vs Thresholds
- **AUC:** 0.692  âœ…
- **KS:** 0.285  âœ…
- **Missing rate (max feature):** 0.0004199  âœ…
- **PSI (max feature):** N/A = N/A  ðŸ”´ (> 0.2)

> > *Tip:* AUC/KS indicate the modelâ€™s discriminatory power; PSI reflects shifts in data distribution; Missing rate indicates data quality.

## 3) Drift & Data Quality
Top drifted features:

- No material drift detected.


Notes: No unusual ETL/schema issues observed.

---

## 4) Fairness Snapshot
Groups evaluated: income_group, addr_state  
80% rule pass: True

Across evaluated groups, approval-rate ratios remained within the 80% rule.

---

## 5) Compliance & Governance
- **FCA Consumer Duty:** Potential variability in outcomes; monitor under FCA Consumer Duty.
- **Equality Act 2010:** No evidence of direct discrimination across monitored groups.
- **Model governance:** Retrain required? **True**  
- **Next review:** Quarterly model committee (scheduled)

---

## 6) Recommended Actions
- Continue daily monitoring.
- - Track 'fico_mid' PSI for 7-14 days.
