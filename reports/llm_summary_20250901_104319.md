### Summary of Findings with Explicit Mapping to FCA Consumer Duty and Fairness

#### Overview
The report generated on August 30, 2025, by Christine Ding, indicates the performance and fairness of the model used for consumer lending. The model's AUC is 0.692, with a slight drop in performance metrics, but it passes the 80% fairness rule.

#### FCA Consumer Duty and Fairness Mapping
1. **Fairness Assessment**:
   - **Pass 80% Rule**: The model has passed the 80% fairness rule, indicating that it treats different consumer groups equitably, which aligns with the FCA's Consumer Duty to ensure fair treatment of customers.
   - **Fairness Groups**: The analysis includes fairness across income groups and state addresses, ensuring that the model does not discriminate against any demographic.

2. **Performance Metrics**:
   - **AUC**: 0.692, which is acceptable but indicates room for improvement.
   - **KS Statistic**: 0.286, suggesting moderate discrimination ability between positive and negative classes.
   - **AUC Drop**: A minor drop of 0.008 suggests stability but requires monitoring.

3. **Data Quality**:
   - **Missing Data**: The maximum missing rate is very low (0.00042), indicating good data quality.
   - **Top Drift Features**: Notable drift observed in 'fico_mid' (PSI: 0.263) and 'log_annual_inc' (PSI: 0.213), which could affect fairness and model performance.

#### Breaches
- **Drift in Key Features**: The significant drift in 'fico_mid' and 'log_annual_inc' may indicate that the model's predictions could become less reliable over time, potentially leading to unfair treatment of certain consumer groups.

#### Mitigations
- **Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring of feature drift and model performance is essential. Implement regular checks to ensure that the model remains fair and effective.
- **Retraining**: Consider retraining the model with updated data to address the drift in key features and enhance predictive accuracy.
- **Bias Audits**: Conduct regular bias audits to ensure that the model remains compliant with FCA Consumer Duty requirements.

#### Next Steps
1. **Implement Monitoring Framework**: Establish a framework for ongoing monitoring of model performance and fairness metrics.
2. **Schedule Model Retraining**: Plan for periodic retraining of the model to incorporate new data and mitigate drift effects.
3. **Conduct Further Analysis**: Investigate the causes of drift in 'fico_mid' and 'log_annual_inc' to understand their impact on consumer outcomes.
4. **Stakeholder Review**: Present findings to stakeholders to ensure transparency and gather feedback for further improvements.

By addressing these areas, the organization can uphold its commitment to fairness and compliance with FCA Consumer Duty standards.
