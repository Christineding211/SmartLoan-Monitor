# SmartLoan â€“ Credit-Risk Prediction, Governance & Monitoring Dashboard

A **lightweight, end-to-end credit-risk prediction and monitoring app** built with **Streamlit**.  
It generates **loan default predictions (Logistic Regression & XGBoost)**, and demonstrates **practical model governance**: **drift tracking (PSI)**, **performance metrics (AUC/KS)**, **explainability (SHAP)**, **fairness testing (80% rule with group cut-offs)**, and **compliance-style reporting** (rule-based + optional **LLM summary for executives**).

## What problem does this solve?
Financial institutions face both decision-making risks and regulatory/reputational risks if their credit-risk models are **not accurate, monitored, explainable, and fair**.
- Unreliable predictions may lead to poor lending decisions and financial losses.
- Models can silently break when data drifts or key inputs go missing.
- Lack of transparent reporting to senior management and regulators.
- Risk of unfair lending outcomes across customer groups (e.g., income segments, geography).
- Teams operate in isolation, lacking a single governance framework.

## This project addresses those problems by providing a central monitoring dashboard that:
- Produces **loan default predictions** and evaluates them with **AUC/KS**.  
- Tracks **model performance** and alerts when thresholds are breached.  
- Detects **data drift** via PSI and flags high-risk features.
- Produces **explainability outputs (SHAP** bar, beeswarm, waterfall plots).
- Runs **fairness checks** (80% rule before vs after group cut-offs).
- Uses **MLflow to track experiments**, ensuring reproducible and optimised model development.  
- Generates **compliance reports** in plain English, with optional **LLM executive summaries**.

## Key features
### 1. New Batch / Monitoring
Upload a new CSV batch and instantly compute metrics (AUC/KS), drift (PSI), and missingness. Provides a one-stop health check for model monitoring.

### 2.Metrics & Drift
Visualises top-K drifted features with PSI, using OK/WARN/ALERT thresholds from config.yaml. Helps spot early warning signs before model degradation.

### 3. Explainability
Generates SHAP plots (bar, beeswarm, and waterfall ) for both Logistic Regression and XGBoost models. Shows which features drive credit-risk predictions.

### 4. Fairness
Tests across income groups (income_group_auth) and regions (addr_state), applying the 80% rule before and after group-specific cut-offs. Shows approval rates and TPR_good snapshots to highlight fairness gaps.

### 5. Compliance & LLM
Automates compliance reports using rule-based thresholds (PSI, AUC/KS drops, fairness checks). Can also produce concise LLM one-pagers tailored for executives, summarising risks, governance issues, and overall model health.
